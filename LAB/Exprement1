AIM:

      To Create a React based website for your client using components, elements and styles.

DESCRIPTION:

      I developed a React-based website using components, elements, and styles to ensure a clean
      and modular design. The site includes reusable components such as header, navigation bar, content
      sections, and footer, making it easy to maintain and scale. React elements (JSX) were used to 
      structure the layout, while custom CSS styles provided responsiveness and brand consistency. 
      Overall, the website is user-friendly, visually appealing, and built to meet the clientâ€™s requirements efficiently.

CODE:

      import React, { useState } from 'react';
      import Hero from '../components/Hero';
      import CarList from '../components/CarList';
      import BookingForm from '../components/BookingForm';
      
      function Home() {
        const [selectedCar, setSelectedCar] = useState(null);
      
        const cars = [
          {
            id: 1,
            name: 'Toyota Corolla',
            type: 'Sedan',
            seats: 5,
            transmission: 'Automatic',
            pricePerDay: 45,

          },
          {
            id: 2,
            name: 'Jeep Wrangler',
            type: 'SUV',
            seats: 5,
            transmission: 'Manual',
            pricePerDay: 80,

          },
          {
            id: 3,
            name: 'Tesla Model 3',
            type: 'Electric',
            seats: 5,
            transmission: 'Automatic',
            pricePerDay: 120,
            image: 'https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1552519507-da3b142c6e3d?q=80&w=1200&auto=format&fit=crop'
          }
        ];
      
        return (
          <>
            <Hero />
            <main>
              <CarList cars={cars} onSelect={setSelectedCar} />
              <BookingForm selectedCar={selectedCar} />
            </main>
          </>
        );
      }
      
      export default Home;

RESULT:

      Thus a  React based website for your client using components, elements and styles created successfully.
